## 📝 How I Use This Repository

1. **Daily Learning Log** (`Day_X.md`)
   - Tracks concepts learned, problems solved, and key insights.
   - Updated throughout the day.

2. **Problem-Specific Notes** (`Problem_Name.md`)
   - Contains problem statements, approaches, solutions, and reflections.
   - Categorized by topics (e.g., `Array/`, `Graph/`).

3. **Templates for Consistency**
   - Automated via Obsidian **Templater Plugin** for structured note-taking.
