# 自我介绍

I'm Xiangyu Wang, you can call me Sky. I'm a junior majoring in Computer Engineering at UCLA. My curiosity and passion for technology have led me to explore different areas of software engineering through research and hands-on projects.

I worked as an undergraduate researcher on reverse-engineering obfuscated code, which sharpened my debugging and low-level systems thinking. I’ve also collaborated on full-stack web apps, where I learned how to build reliable, user-facing systems with teammates. Additionally, I’ve built and maintained e-commerce websites that directly supported product sales. I’ve also completed several hardware-focused projects for embedded development, which gave me broader system-level understanding.

These experiences have shaped me into a fast learner, an effective team player, and someone who enjoys solving meaningful technical challenges. I’ve built a strong foundation in programming and system design, with reliability, and automation at the core. I’m excited to bring my skills and mindset to the SRE Intern role at TikTok and grow with a team that share the same values. (innovation, impact, and global collaboration)
